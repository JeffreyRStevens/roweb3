## Package development corner

Some useful tips for R package developers. :eyes:

Do you have some questions around licensing of your R package?
The [license chapter](https://r-pkgs.org/license.html) of the R packages book by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan was [recently](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/1307338435976364032) updated.
A less recent but interesting read is [Colin Fay's Licensing R e-book](https://thinkr-open.github.io/licensing-r/index.html).

Resources roundup encoding?
"If the DESCRIPTION file is not entirely in ASCII it should contain an ‘Encoding’ field specifying an encoding. This is used as the encoding of the DESCRIPTION file itself and of the R and NAMESPACE files, and as the default encoding of .Rd files. "
