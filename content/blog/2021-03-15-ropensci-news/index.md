Dear rOpenSci friends, it's time for our monthly news roundup!
Yes, the latest one was on 2021-02-08.
Some housekeeping first:
We've been changing the infrastructure of our newsletter a bit so please update your RSS and JSON feeds to `https://ropensci.org/tags/newsletter/index.xml` and `https://ropensci.org/tags/newsletter/index.json`, respectively.
You can read this post [on our blog](/blog/2021/03/15/ropensci-news).
Now let's dive into the activity at and around rOpenSci!

## rOpenSci HQ

Our R-universe project now has its own page on our website! :rocket:

Regarding another exciting project of ours... We've run the first comm call of our series on [statistical software review project](/stat-software-review/)! [rOpenSci Statistical Software Testing and Peer Review](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/feb2021-statsreview/) took place on March the 2d, blabla, resources up, recording up, blabla.

## Software :package:

### New packages




The following 6 packages recently became a part of our software suite:

+ [osmextract](https://docs.ropensci.org/osmextract), developed by Andrea Gilardi together with Robin Lovelace: Find, download, convert and read Open Street Map data extracts obtained from several providers.  It is available on [CRAN]( https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=osmextract). It has been [reviewed](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/395) by Salva Fern√°ndez, Nicholas Potter.

+ [pendulum](https://docs.ropensci.org/pendulum), developed by Scott Chamberlain: Time classes, with hooks for mocking time. 

+ [pixelclasser](https://docs.ropensci.org/pixelclasser), developed by Carlos Real: Contains functions to classify the pixels of an image file (jpeg or tiff) by its colour. It implements a simple form of the techniques known as Support Vector Machine adapted to this particular problem. It has been [reviewed](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/406) by Quentin Read.

+ [tarchetypes](https://docs.ropensci.org/tarchetypes), developed by William Michael Landau: Function-oriented Make-like declarative workflows for Statistics and data science are supported in the 'targets' R package. As an extension to 'targets', the 'tarchetypes' package provides convenient user-side functions to make 'targets' easier to use. By establishing reusable archetypes for common kinds of targets and pipelines, these functions help express complicated reproducible workflows concisely and compactly. The methods in this package were influenced by the 'drake' R package by Will Landau (2018) <doi:10.21105/joss.00550>.  It is available on [CRAN]( https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tarchetypes). It has been [reviewed](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/401) by Samantha Oliver, Tristan Mahr.

+ [targets](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets), developed by William Michael Landau: As a pipeline toolkit for Statistics and data science in R, the 'targets' package brings together function-oriented programming and 'Make'-like declarative workflows. It analyzes the dependency relationships among the tasks of a workflow, skips steps that are already up to date, runs the necessary computation with optional parallel workers, abstracts files as R objects, and provides tangible evidence that the results match the underlying code and data. The methodology in this package borrows from GNU 'Make' (2015, ISBN:978-9881443519) and 'drake' (2018, <doi:10.21105/joss.00550>).  It is available on [CRAN]( https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=targets). It has been [reviewed](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/401) by Samantha Oliver, Tristan Mahr.

+ [terrainr](https://docs.ropensci.org/terrainr), developed by Michael Mahoney: Functions for the retrieval, manipulation, and visualization of 'geospatial' data, with an aim towards producing '3D' landscape visualizations in the 'Unity' '3D' rendering engine. Functions are also provided for retrieving elevation data and base map tiles from the 'USGS' National Map ('<https://apps.nationalmap.gov/services/>'). It has been [reviewed](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/416) by Mike Johnson, Sydney Foks.

## Package development corner

Some useful tips for R package developers. :eyes:

Do you have some questions around licensing of your R package?
The [license chapter](https://r-pkgs.org/license.html) of the R packages book by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan was [recently](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/1307338435976364032) updated.
A less recent but interesting read is [Colin Fay's Licensing R e-book](https://thinkr-open.github.io/licensing-r/index.html).

Resources roundup encoding?
"If the DESCRIPTION file is not entirely in ASCII it should contain an ‚ÄòEncoding‚Äô field specifying an encoding. This is used as the encoding of the DESCRIPTION file itself and of the R and NAMESPACE files, and as the default encoding of .Rd files. "
