### New packages

The following packages recently became a part of our software suite:



+ [osmextract](https://docs.ropensci.org/osmextract), developed by Andrea Gilardi together with Robin Lovelace: Find, download, convert and read Open Street Map data extracts obtained from several providers.  It is available on [CRAN]( https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=osmextract). It has been [reviewed](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/395).

+ [pendulum](https://docs.ropensci.org/pendulum), developed by Scott Chamberlain: Time classes, with hooks for mocking time. 

+ [pixelclasser](https://docs.ropensci.org/pixelclasser), developed by Carlos Real: Contains functions to classify the pixels of an image file (jpeg or tiff) by its colour. It implements a simple form of the techniques known as Support Vector Machine adapted to this particular problem. 

+ [tarchetypes](https://docs.ropensci.org/tarchetypes), developed by William Michael Landau: Function-oriented Make-like declarative workflows for Statistics and data science are supported in the 'targets' R package. As an extension to 'targets', the 'tarchetypes' package provides convenient user-side functions to make 'targets' easier to use. By establishing reusable archetypes for common kinds of targets and pipelines, these functions help express complicated reproducible workflows concisely and compactly. The methods in this package were influenced by the 'drake' R package by Will Landau (2018) <doi:10.21105/joss.00550>.  It is available on [CRAN]( https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tarchetypes). It has been [reviewed](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/401).

+ [targets](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets), developed by William Michael Landau: As a pipeline toolkit for Statistics and data science in R, the 'targets' package brings together function-oriented programming and 'Make'-like declarative workflows. It analyzes the dependency relationships among the tasks of a workflow, skips steps that are already up to date, runs the necessary computation with optional parallel workers, abstracts files as R objects, and provides tangible evidence that the results match the underlying code and data. The methodology in this package borrows from GNU 'Make' (2015, ISBN:978-9881443519) and 'drake' (2018, <doi:10.21105/joss.00550>).  It is available on [CRAN]( https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=targets). It has been [reviewed](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/401).
